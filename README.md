Project to learn python while doing a module

---
## how to set up:

download the module inside the [release](https://github.com/CrowHugin/password-manager/releases/) page


**On linux:**
give it the permission to run with:
```bash
chmod u+x ./Password_manager
```

you can find the stored passwords within: 
	~/password_manager/stock.csv


**On Windows:**
Isn't supported  yet but should work inside wsl2


---
## How to use it:

There are three options you can use to use:
	-a or --add to add an email, a password and a website into the storage file  
	-v or --view to view any required info  
	-c to create a password (must be less than 20 character long)

these three options can / must be use with:
	-em or --email to put an email within the options -a and-v  
	-p or --password to put a password within the options -a and -v  
	-w or --website to put a website within the options -a and -v

Please remind  I'm still learning and this project isn't one to take too seriously.

I'm doing it because it's fun :)
