Project to learn python while doing a module

## use:

download the module inside the [release](https://github.com/CrowHugin/password-manager/releases/) page


**On linux:**
give it the permission to run with:
```bash
chmod u+x ./Password_manager
```

you can find the stored passwords within: 
	~/password_manager/stock.csv


**On Windows:**
Isn't supported  yet but should work inside wsl



This project is for making a password manager.
I'm doing it because it's fun :)
